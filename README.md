# Customer Churn Analysis  

## Executive Summary  
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of **customer churn for a telecom company**. The goal was to identify the key drivers of churn and segment customers for targeted retention campaigns. Using **Python** and popular data analysis libraries, the project uncovers insights into customer demographics, services, and contract types most susceptible to churning. These findings provide a **data-driven foundation** for strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Business Problem  
Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies as it directly impacts **revenue, growth, and customer lifetime value**. Without understanding why customers leave, companies risk losing valuable customers and competitive edge. This project addresses the problem by identifying the **root causes of churn** and suggesting actionable strategies for proactive intervention.

## Methodology  
The analysis followed a structured approach using **Python**:  

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded the dataset into Pandas DataFrame.  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., `customerID`).  
   - Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric and imputed missing values.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Converted `Churn` column from categorical (Yes/No) to numerical (1/0).  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed churn rate across demographics, contract types, and services.  
   - Explored relationships between customer behavior and churn.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to highlight churn drivers and patterns.

## Results & Insights  
- **Gender**: Has little to no effect on churn.  
- **Senior Citizens**: Churn at a much higher rate compared to younger customers.
