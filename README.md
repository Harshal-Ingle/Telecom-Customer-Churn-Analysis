# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes a telecom dataset to identify the primary factors that lead to customer churn. The goal is to build a customer profile of those likely to churn and provide actionable recommendations for targeted retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle, containing demographic, account, and service information for thousands of customers.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

1.  **Contract is King:** Customers on month-to-month contracts have a churn rate several times higher than those on annual contracts.

2.  **New Customers are Vulnerable:** The first 1-5 months are a critical period, with a large portion of churn occurring here.

3.  **Protective Services Matter:** Customers without add-ons like Online Security and Tech Support are far more likely to churn.

## Business Recommendations
- **Launch a "First-Year Loyalty Plan":** Offer a compelling discount for new month-to-month customers to upgrade to a 1-year contract.
- **Bundle "Sticky" Services:** Proactively offer services like Online Security for free for the first 3 months to high-risk customers.
- **Develop a Senior-Focused Plan:** Create and market a simplified, tailored plan for the high-churn senior citizen demographic.
